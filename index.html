Do you have the passion to deliver maritime support within 11Sqn on a variety of small craft? Are you a pro-active, hard-working individual? One who is motivated to play an engaging, interesting and critical part in our support to Navy Command’s role to generate and operate forces for today and to ensure we are ready for tomorrow by developing and delivering the Navy of the future.</p>

Timing of 11 Squadron's activities is constrained by tidal conditions which means that there will be requirements to work outside normal hours for which a premium will be paid in line with MOD policy.</p>
